# AndroidApp_EarthQuiz

This is my first Android application, a simple quiz that assesses the user's knowledge about the world's geography. 

Through this fun personal project, I gained valuable experience with Android Studio, Java, and Android development, including
Activities, Intents, Activity Lifecycles, object-oriented programming, UI design, creating listeners, and MVC-oriented software
architecture/design.
